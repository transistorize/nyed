NY State Election District Maps


This is a project to coalesce all the public geographic data about election districts and other infrequently used administrative designations. Many parties offer geographic data on congressional districts at the federal and sometimes the state level, but election districts are harder to come by.

All Shape and Geojson format files are converted to [Topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) to keep the file sizes down. Compressed Geojson files are ok, but I believe are not natively [displayed](https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements) within Github. All data files should have a source file listed, so that one can confirm the origin of the data and the process of transformation.


If you use this data to make visualizations, let me know and I will list it below.
