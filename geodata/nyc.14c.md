For the files ny*.14c.topojson files that focus on New York City, the source is the 14c release from the [BYTES of the BIG APPLE](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/districts_download_metadata.shtml) (tm). The Shapefiles were converted to Geojson first, using the GDAL ogr2ogr [commandline tool](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/), and then these files in turn were converted to Topojson using that project's [commandline tool](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/Command-Line-Reference). For some reason, trying to convert the Shapefile directly to Topojson did not work.
